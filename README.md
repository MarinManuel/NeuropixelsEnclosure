Our design is meant to accomodate the [Neuropixels rods from Sensapex](https://sensapex.com/shop/product/ump-npr-200/). Minor adjustments may be needed to accomodate holders with different diamters.

# Instructions
After 3 printing the blocks, install the heat-set inserts in the back and next to each of the holes in the top block. Be careful not to push the inset too far so that it does not interfere with the rod.

Mount the blocks on the mounting plate of the junction box. Use the grid to ensure that the top and bottom blocks are aligned

Install the mounting plate inside the junction box.

The bottom block can accomodate 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes for cleaning the probes and for protecting the shank when not in use.
